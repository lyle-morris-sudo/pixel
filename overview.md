# Overview

Pixel is a foundation design system that can be rapidly themed (e.g., color, sizing, shapes) based on your business unit or product portfolio. This approach relies on using its advance token architecture to:

- Rapidly change the look and feel of the design language within a single sprint as opposed to multiple sprints.
- Reduces sustainment/enhancement costs long term.
- Works with other design systems as a sustainment service. Eventually consolidating patterns, components, and experiences into centralized shared assets for all product portfolios.
- Provides forward looking strategy to maintain a modern visual presentation layer for all products while reducing enhancement costs long term.

## Anatomy

The design system is made up of key components that work together. Without either one, the system does not exist:

- **Design Language** – The design language provides a shared visual language to be applied to a product. This would include designers using a design system kit with a defined design stack software (e.g., Figma, Sketch, Adobe, Axure).

- **Code Language** – Front-end code at supports the language components and patterns. This is usually provided to developers as individual packages through a repository. These packages can be provided in various languages that support the product build (e.g., React, Angular).

- **Appendix** – The Pixel macro-system is not to completely replace any established design system within a business unit, but to supplement using appendix micro-systems. All applications have unique components and patterns that will not translate well to other applications. These items should remain in a dedicated appendix system. Through the maturity of the macro-system, consolidations and assets reduction will impact the micro-systems creating more centralized consistency with design and experience.

## Principles

These are principles that govern the design system. Both the design language and code may have their own guiding principles.

- **Open Community** – everyone is encouraged to contribute to the design and code. To create a health system, it depends on input from others, especially research gathered through various business units and products. This helps to continuously validate components and patterns that everyone can benefit from.

- **Modular and Flexibility** – The system’s modularity ensures maximum flexibility in execution. Its components are designed to work seamlessly with each other, in whichever combination suits the needs of the user.

- **User Centered Focus** – All assets of the design system should have supported validation research and accessibility supporting it. This information should be continuously validated to provide a healthy system.

- **Enterprise Consistency** – Every component and pattern were designed from the ground up to work elegantly together to ensure consistent, cohesive user experiences across all business units.

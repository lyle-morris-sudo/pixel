# Getting Started

Pixel is a foundation design system that can be rapidly themed (e.g., color, sizing, shapes) based on your business unit or product portfolio. This approach relies on using its advance token architecture to:

- Rapidly change the look and feel of the design language within a single sprint as opposed to multiple sprints.
- Reduces sustainment/enhancement costs long term.
- Works with other design systems as a sustainment service. Eventually consolidating patterns, components, and experiences into centralized shared assets for all product portfolios.
- Provides forward looking strategy to maintain a modern visual presentation layer for all products while reducing enhancement costs long term.

## Anatomy

The design system is made up of key components that work together. Without either one, the system does not exist:

- **Design Language** – The design language provides a shared visual language to be applied to a product. This would include designers using a design system kit with a defined design stack software (e.g., Figma, Sketch, Adobe, Axure).

- **Code Language** – Front-end code at supports the language components and patterns. This is usually provided to developers as individual packages through a repository. These packages can be provided in various languages that support the product build (e.g., React, Angular).

- **Appendix** – The Pixel macro-system is not to completely replace any established design system within a business unit, but to supplement using appendix micro-systems. All applications have unique components and patterns that will not translate well to other applications. These items should remain in a dedicated appendix system. Through the maturity of the macro-system, consolidations and assets reduction will impact the micro-systems creating more centralized consistency with design and experience.

## Principles

These are principles that govern the design system. Both the design language and code may have their own guiding principles.

- **Open Community** – everyone is encouraged to contribute to the design and code. To create a health system, it depends on input from others, especially research gathered through various business units and products. This helps to continuously validate components and patterns that everyone can benefit from.

- **Modular and Flexibility** – The system’s modularity ensures maximum flexibility in execution. Its components are designed to work seamlessly with each other, in whichever combination suits the needs of the user.

- **User Centered Focus** – All assets of the design system should have supported validation research and accessibility supporting it. This information should be continuously validated to provide a healthy system.

- **Enterprise Consistency** – Every component and pattern were designed from the ground up to work elegantly together to ensure consistent, cohesive user experiences across all business units.

## Get access to the Pixel DSK

### Figma

Download and install the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) application, or use the web based application.

#### Get Figma editor license

Figma is the approved software at Fiserv. You can install the software through Fiserv's self-service application. Use your FEAD network credentials to sign into the application. You should be added to the Fiserv Figma organization automatically once you sign in. 

If you are not an editor, you will have restricted viewer permissions. To get editor access, you will need to request it through [Fiserv ServicePoint](https://fiservservicepoint.fiservapps.com/nav_to.do?uri=/com.glideapp.servicecatalog_cat_item_view.do?v%3D1%26sysparm_id%3D121e6a341bcc6110f203dc27b04bcb96%26sysparm_link_parent%3Daba18e41375742007ab3a503b3990e82%26sysparm_catalog%3De0d08b13c3330100c8b837659bba8fb4%26sysparm_catalog_view%3Dcatalog_default%26sysparm_view%3Dtext_search).

#### Enabling the DSK library

By default, the Pixel design kit should be loaded on new files by default. If this is not the case, you can turn on the library inside of a design file. Navigate to the Main menu panel in the top left of the toolbar (A). Open the menu and select Libraries from the list (B).

4. Included in the library are all Pixel components and their variants. To insert a component, go to the Asset panel and find the component you would like to use. Drag it from the asset panel onto the canvas. View the name of the component in the right sidebar. If the component has variants, you’ll see fields underneath the component name to configure the properties and values of that component set. For more help on how to use Figma components, see the [Figma Support](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056440594-Create-and-use-variants#Use_variants).

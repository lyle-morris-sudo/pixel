# Foundations

| Foundations  | Description |
| :--------- | :---------- |
| [Colors](../guidelines/color.md)            | The default themes are derived from the design system's color palette. |
| [Sizing](../guidelines/size_and_spacing.md) | The sizing tokens help you control the proportions of your system’s components at the atom level for global consistency. |
| [Spacing](../guidelines/size_and_spacing.md)| Spacing is an important - and often overlooked — part of product design. |
| [Typography](../guidelines/typography.md)   | Our approach to the typographic system uses Fiserv approved **Open Sans** as its default typeface. |
